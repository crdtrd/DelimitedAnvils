## DelimitedAnvils
## Summary
A server side fabric mod that removes the level limit on anvils.
## Features
- No more xp cost limit on anvil operations. 
- Properly displays the level cost beyond level 39 (up until 6 digit level costs then things start getting a little funky, but who's ever going that high?)
- Combine and rename your stuff with impunity!
